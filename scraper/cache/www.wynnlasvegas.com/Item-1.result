    "description": "Andrea's at Encore is a Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star Award-winning restaurant that combines Chef Joseph Elevado's menu of Asian-inspired cuisine with a sexy and social atmosphere. Discover for yourself why Andrea's was voted one of the country’s hottest dining spots in the OpenTable Diners’ Choice Awards. Overlooking the pool of Encore Beach Club, delicious beats will set the mood as you dine on specialties like the Wagyu beef and lobster roll, New York strip steak with wasabi demi glacé, or five-spice garlic lobster.\n\nTHE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER\n \nThe Impossible Burger has quickly become a food world sensation, but can only be found at a handful of restaurants in America. The 100% plant based burger has recently made its debut in Las Vegas, available exclusively at Andrea’s. Designed with meat lovers in mind, The Impossible Burger looks, cooks, smells and tastes like ground beef, but is better for the planet and completely cholesterol free. \n\nDINNER & SHOW PAIRINGS\n \nEnjoy a selection of dishes and cocktails before the 7 p.m. performance of Le Rêve—The Dream.\nDETAILS",
