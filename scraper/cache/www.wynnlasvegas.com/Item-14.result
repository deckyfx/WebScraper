    "description": "Imagine enjoying the freshest seasonal cuisine in an airy, conservatory-like setting overlooking shimmering pools and manicured greenery. Jardin, Encore’s newest relaxed-dining restaurant, offers panoramic views of the Encore pool and is the setting for Chef Joseph Zanelli’s garden of delights for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurant offers casual elegance with a menu that is equal parts innovative and approachable American cuisine. Choose from classics like the crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich with mustard slaw and garlic-herb ranch or a juicy, grilled Kurobuta pork chop topped with mushroom ragout and orange sage sauce. Breakfast features mouthwatering options like short rib and egg sliders and Maine lobster Benedict. Dine inside for the best vantage of Jardin’s in-the-round views, or request a patio table to immerse yourself in the picturesque setting day or night.\n\nLAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK\n\nLas Vegas Restaurant Week offers the unique opportunity to indulge in world-class cuisine while giving back to our community.
