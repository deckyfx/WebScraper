    "description": "The Country Club—A New American Steakhouse presents innovative fare by Chef Rene Lenger overlooking the 18th hole on the Wynn Golf Course. A Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star Award-winner, this restaurant is the realization of Steve Wynn's vision to create an upscale golf club that would be accessible to all guests. Savor charred-to-perfection steaks, ocean fresh seafood and prime rib elegantly carved table-side. The Country Club serves lunch, dinner and brunch on weekends, with a unique Jazz Brunch offered on Sundays.\n\nJAZZ BRUNCH\n\nThis bountiful Sunday brunch buffet, which includes a carving station and selections from Lenger’s kitchen, is accompanied by the spirited jazz of a live Dixieland band. See for yourself why the Southern Nevada Hotel Concierge Association named this the \"Best Brunch\" in Las Vegas for the second consecutive year. \n\nTHE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER \n\nThe sensational Impossible Burger, found only at a handful of restaurants in America, recently made its debut in Las Vegas, available exclusively at Wynn. The Impossible Burger is 100% plant based and looks, cooks, smells and tastes like ground beef, but is better for the planet and completely cholesterol free. The Impossible Burger is now available at The Country Club for lunch Monday through Saturday.",
