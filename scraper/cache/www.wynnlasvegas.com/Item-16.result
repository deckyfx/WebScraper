    "description": "If you find you are in need of some good luck, or you have found good fortune and wish to celebrate it, look no further than the enticing Asian flavors of Red 8 at Wynn. The diverse menu offers familiar favorites—and exotic cuisine that perhaps you have yet to try—from China, Thailand, Vietnam and Korea. Some of Red 8's specialties include Cantonese noodle dishes, dim sum, perfectly prepared vegetable dishes, and Hong Kong-style barbecue. The dining room is saturated with rich reds and interesting textures, and be sure to look to the ceiling as you walk through the entry way to catch a glimpse of a well-hidden design element that adds a touch of artistic inventiveness.",
