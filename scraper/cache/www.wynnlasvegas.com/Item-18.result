    "description": "Inventive fare in a wondrously unanticipated environment is what you'll find in Wazuzu at Encore. Chef Chen Wei Chan's exceptional Pan-Asian menu features flavors inspired by Chinese, Japanese, and Thai cuisine. Chef Chan’s training as a painter in Taiwan shows in the artful plating of his dishes, which succeed in being as beautiful as the glittering 27-foot dragon made of ninety thousand individual crystals that is the focal point of Wazuzu’s bold décor. Be sure to try the drunken noodles that were featured on Food Network’s \"Best Thing I Ever Ate.\"",
