    "description": "Indulge in a feast for all your senses amid the resplendent surroundings of the all-new buffet at Wynn, voted the \"Best Buffet\" in Las Vegas by the Southern Nevada Hotel Concierge Association. Sample tastes from around the world at the 15 live-action cooking stations presenting rotisserie grilled steakhouse cuts, coast-to-coast seafood and over 120 new dishes, all artfully presented. Newly reimagined décor and impeccable attention to detail imbue what is traditionally a casual dining experience with a fine dining sensibility. The finale is provided by the sweet patisserie, featuring warm pastries, chocolate fountain dipped specialties and an assortment of cakes and confections made daily by our dedicated pastry chefs. As USA Today notes in their review, \"If there's one thing this town is good at, it's taking a great buffet and making it even better.\"\n\nDINNER & SHOW PAIRINGS\n\nVisit The Buffet before or after experiencing timeless icon Diana Ross, legendary funny man Mel Brooks or the award-winning aquatic spectacular Le Rêve – The Dream.\nDETAILS",
