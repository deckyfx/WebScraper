    "description": "From its rolling greens to its white-sand bunkers and rushing streams, you may forget you're in Las Vegas while at the Wynn Golf Club. The 18-hole, par-70 course—designed by Tom Fazio and Steve Wynn—was conceived with the rolling hills of South Carolina or Georgia in mind. As a part of being the only golf course attached to a resort on the Las Vegas strip, our team is well prepared to get you from room-to-tee-box without ever leaving the resort. If you can't bring your own equipment complimentary clubs by Callaway and shoes by Foot Joy are always provided and our professional caddies are available to help you master the course. \nStarting reservations vary seasonally; please call our golf reservation specialists at (702) 770-4653 for available tee times.",
