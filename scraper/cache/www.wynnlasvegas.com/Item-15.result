    "description": "Low ceilings and quiet nooks are what you'll find behind the glass facade and revolving door that is set into the hallway next-door to Terrace Pointe Café at Wynn. At La Cave—Wine & Food Hideaway you'll savor Chef Billy DeMarco's menu of small-plate items from the sea, farm, oven, garden, grill and butcher, paired with artisanal draught beers and an impressive wine list. La Cave offers three distinct environments—the cellar, the front bar area illuminated from above by a sign proclaiming In Vino Veritas, the rustic yet refined dining room, and a patio that looks out over the elegantly-landscaped Wynn resort pool and gardens.",
