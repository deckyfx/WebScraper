    "description": "Terrace Pointe Café at Wynn showcases lively decor, replete with sunlight that streams in from the floor-to-ceiling, panoramic view of the carefully manicured gardens surrounding the Wynn resort pool. Breakfast, lunch and brunch favorites are deliciously reinvented and perfectly prepared in this relaxed café with a refined feel. Dine on a variety of specialties like brioche French toast, truffle mushroom Angus burger, or indulge in a triple thick malted shake or banana split waffle bowl sundae poolside on the sizable patio.",
